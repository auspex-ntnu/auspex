# THIS MODULE IS OUTDATED AND UNFINISHED

We originally planned to trigger Google Cloud Workflows from the REST API, but we decided instead to manually orchestrate the service flows by sending HTTP requests from the API Gateway endpoint methods instead.

Instead of deleting this module, we will keep it around for now, but it will be removed in the future if we decide to keep using the current workflow mechanism.
